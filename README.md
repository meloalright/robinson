* inline -> into anonymous block (build_layout_tree)

* line break segment and soft wrap opportunity break into inline formatting context and bounding (layout)


* if Text means tag
- it can literal styled (display)
- it can context styling
- it children should be content string
- (or it can contains other tag children)
- when it display block
  - it should create a new anonymous line inside
    - then split text runs
    - (or inline layout inline children tags and split)
- when it display inline
  - it should merge into one bubble inline formatting context and split runs
- when it display inline-block
  - it should create a new anonymous line inside
    - then split text runs
    - (or inline layout inline children tags and split)

* if Text means tag but macro checked (better)
- it can not check pass any tag children
- it can not check pass any children
- it can literal styled but can not check passed display not inline
- it can context styling
- (it parent if block will have create a new anonymous line -> then layout inline children tags and split it)
- (it parent will not be checked pass inline or measurable)
- (it parent if inline-block will have create a new anonymous line -> then layout inline children tags and split it)

* if Text means string
- it can not contain any tag children
- it can not have any children
- it can not literal styled (display)
- it can context styling
- (it parent if block will have create a new anonymous line -> then layout inline children tags and split it)
- (it parent if inline -> merge into deep bubble inline formatting context and split runss)
- (it parent if inline-block will have create a new anonymous line -> then layout inline children tags and split it)

* inline formatting context have to use index but not borrow
